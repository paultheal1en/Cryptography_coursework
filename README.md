This repository provides a reimplementation of Achieving Searchable and Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing for Cloud-Assisted E-Healthcare System, as described in the paper by Xu et al. (2019). The implementation is written in **C** for performance-critical components and exported to **Python** via a shared library (`.so` file) for ease of use and integration into modern applications. The project focuses on achieving secure and efficient data sharing while preserving privacy in cloud-assisted e-healthcare systems.
